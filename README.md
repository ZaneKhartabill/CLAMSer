##  Features

*   **⚙️ Flexible Setup:** Configure analysis parameters, time windows (24h, 48h, 7d, etc., or custom ranges), and light/dark cycles.
*   **⬆️ Direct Upload:** Upload raw CSV output files directly from the Oxymax-CLAMS-CF machine.
*   **⚖️ Lean Mass Normalization:** Optionally normalize metabolic data (VO2, VCO2, HEAT) to lean body mass for more accurate comparisons.
*   **👥 Group Management:** Easily assign animals (identified from file headers) into experimental groups.
*   **📊 Interactive Overview:** Visualize overall trends and individual animal timelines with interactive Plotly charts. View key metrics and detailed light/dark/hourly data tables.
*   **📈 Statistical Analysis:**
    *   Perform **Two-Way ANOVA** (Group x Light/Dark Cycle) to assess main effects and interactions.
    *   Includes **Tukey HSD post-hoc tests** for pairwise comparisons when ANOVA is significant.
    *   Option for quick **t-tests / One-Way ANOVA** on specific data slices (e.g., Dark Cycle Averages).
    *   Clear interpretation guides and visualizations (Interaction Plot).
*   **📄 Publication-Ready Plots:** Generate high-quality, static plots (Bar Charts, 24h Patterns, Timelines) using Matplotlib and `scienceplots` styling. Downloadable in PNG, PDF, and SVG formats.
*   **✅ Transparency & Verification:** Dedicated tab explaining calculation methods, providing a step-by-step walkthrough with sample data, and allowing download of processed data for independent verification.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

*   **Python 3**
*   **Streamlit:** For the web application interface.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*   **Plotly:** For interactive visualizations.
*   **Matplotlib & SciencePlots:** For static, publication-quality plots.
*   **SciPy & Statsmodels & Scikit-posthocs:** For statistical calculations (ANOVA, t-tests, post-hoc).

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Using the Live App

The easiest way to use CLAMSer is via the deployed web application:

➡️ **[Access CLAMSer Live App](clamser.streamlit.app)** 

Need CLAMS data for this to work.

### Running Locally

If you want to run the application on your own machine:

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.8 or newer installed.
*   Git installed.

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zane-Khartabil/CLAMSer-.git
    cd CLAMSer-
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application should automatically open in your web browser.
